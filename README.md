Radiations, specifically neutrons and gamma are acquired from different sources and are incident on various scintillators. The light output is collected in both analogue and digital format. Pulse Shape Discrimination is the process of analyzing different signal features which can lead to classifying a waveform as a neutron or a gamma. This work includes applying the conventional techniques to reproduce established results as well as introducing modern deep learning algorithms to increase the ability of discrimination. The conventional methods include extracting signal features like total area/ tail area, decay time, spectral energy density and calculating figure of merit. While new age AI techniques involve applying machine learning algorithms or neural networks to build an efficient classifier. Also a curved fitting algorithm has also been tested on the pulse data of CsI detector with AmBe source.
